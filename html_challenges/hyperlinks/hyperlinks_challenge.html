   <h1>my new life of coding</h1>
   <p> have you ever been on a wack website and you actually thought 'i could do better than that'?. Now that is how i got intrested in coding , its a pity that i didnt do take computer lessons in highschool. i came to Cape Town looking for school but i didnt get any luckly my aunt introduced me to the Lifechoices academy. I filled in an online form and the rest was history. So this is how I got introduced to the 'coding life'</p>
   <p>coding is very intresting and all but its alot of work that needs dedication , consistence , time management , self confidence and creativity.Now lucky for me I was one of the +-40 students that was choosen by Life Choices to take part in the coding course. the best thimg about it is that they dont just teach you how to code. The course goes Life Skills , Professional development and self learning skills. so ive learnt alot and still learning im still on my 4th week with Life Choices and ive learnt so much - i can say more than ive learnt in high school- so have them "mentor" me into the industry is a privilege for me , infact i dont think theres a way that i could thank them. all im doing now trying to show them i wasnt choosen by mistake. </p>
